## OHA IWU — Sector Coherence Framework

**“A constitution is not written. It is lived.”**

OHA IWU is the *constitutional service layer* for OBINexus — a sector-based design for economic and social coherence.
It exists to protect the most vulnerable first and to integrate **law, technology, design, and health/social care** into one living framework.

---

### ⚖️ 1. Principle: Protection Before Profit

Every OHA node operates by one rule:

> “If the system fails the vulnerable, the system has failed.”

* **Fail-safe law** → no citizen denied access to housing, food, or transit due to lack of funds.
* **Bidirectional care** → every actor (public, private, agent, or user) can *assist* and *be assisted*.
* **Constitutional economy** → transactions are measured not by capital gain, but by coherence (how well the system self-heals).

### 🧩 2. Sector Model

| Sector                        | Focus                                                                  | Example                                          |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **A. Design & Technology**    | Build the tools and DAG infrastructure (law → logic → ledger).         | OHA IWU repo, Red-Black/AVL hybrid model.        |
| **B. Health & Social Care**   | Address interlinked failures: health, social exclusion, housing.       | HDIS-style coherence agents for social response. |
| **C. Transport & Access**     | Guarantee human movement and return safety.                            | TFL–Oyster case below.                           |
| **D. Law & Governance (IWU)** | Define constitutional thresholds, witness receipts, and dispute rules. | OBINexus legal framework.                        |

Each sector must **self-balance like an AVL tree** and **stabilize like a Red-Black ledger** — fast to correct, slow to collapse.

### 💡 3. Applied Example — The Oyster Case

**Problem:**
A commuter cannot afford an Oyster top-up to return home. TFL policy currently issues a fine.
The person becomes *criminalized for poverty.*

**OHA Resolution:**

* The **Transport sector** flags this as a **coherence fault**, not a criminal act.
* An **OHA assistant agent** (human or system) issues a *temporary cover payment* — a lawful bridge, logged to the social ledger.
* The transaction is recorded as a **social care expenditure**, not a crime.
* The user’s balance updates under the KNN cluster (community node) → the cost can later be offset via micro-task or reserve credit.

**Result:**
The vulnerable commuter gets home safely.
The system logs a shortfall, rebalances locally, and prevents escalation to police or court.
This is *constitutional economics in action.*

### 🧠 4. Architecture Snapshot

| Layer                         | Function                                                                                          |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Edge Agent (HDIS node)**    | Runs local KNN → monitors supply/demand and coherence.                                            |
| **Cluster Index (AVL Tree)**  | Balances local resources (housing, transport, food).                                              |
| **Ledger (Red-Black Hybrid)** | Stores assets and exposures (red = volatile, black = stable).                                     |
| **Routing**                   | Uses A* and cost maps to find optimal resource flows.                                             |
| **Governance**                | Applies machine-verifiable law: no forced consent, minimum reserve ratios, fair witness receipts. |

**Core equation:**
`coherence_i = sigmoid(α * (S_i / (D_i + ε)))`
When coherence drops → trigger rebalancing, not punishment.

### 🌍 5. Goal: Constitutional Automation

By integrating **social care**, **design**, and **law** into one computational model,
OHA aims to replace bureaucratic failure loops (delay–deny–defend–defer) with **self-correcting constitutional logic**.

Every commit, every witness receipt, every node is a *vote for coherence.*

# A — Metaphor → Mechanism (short & sharp)

* **KNN clusters = local economic neighborhoods.**
  Each node’s *influence* on price/availability is proportional to its KNN density and reliability score. When peers join/leave, local supply/demand shifts.

* **AVL tree = fast local rebalancer.**
  Use AVL-like balancing on *local* indices (e.g., resource buckets per cluster). Balance factor → `supply − demand` metric; rotations → immediate local resource redistribution or dynamic fee change.

* **Red-Black tree = ledger-level stability + amortized cost control.**
  RB trees let ledger indices remain height-bounded even under lots of inserts/deletes (participants, claims, witness receipts). Color semantics can encode risk vs reserve:

  * **Black nodes** = reserved, stable holdings (backstop buffer, collateral).
  * **Red nodes** = high-velocity exposures (loans, outstanding obligations).
    Recoloring/rotations are equivalent to reclassifying exposures or triggering reserve transfers.

* **Topology (star/mesh/hybrid) = availability & trust map.**
  Static central nodes give durable services; dynamic peers provide local elasticity. Use hybrid topology: clusters (mesh inside) connected by sparse star links to durable anchors.

* **Witness receipts / witness-NFTs = evidence of coherence.**
  Local node’s action mints a short, signed receipt proving uptime / successful self-heal. These feed funding-mitigation and entitlement decisions.

# B — Compact model: money as a vector field

Treat each account/user/node balance as a vector in `R^d` where each dimension is a spending domain (housing, travel, food, services...). Example `d=3`:

```
v = [v_house, v_travel, v_food]
```

A system price is a **field** `P(x,t)` where `x` is node position in graph (cluster) and `t` time. Transactions move mass through that field.

Define local supply/demand at node `i`:

```
S_i = Σ supply_capacity of i (housing beds, transport seats, food units)
D_i = Σ demand_i (requests, pending bookings)
balance_i = S_i - D_i   // can be positive (surplus) or negative (shortage)
```

Define **local coherence score** (0..1) — your HDIS style:

```
coherence_i = sigmoid( α * (S_i / (D_i + ε)) )   // α tunes sensitivity
```

**Economic balance factor** (analogy to AVL balance factor):

```
econ_balance_i = supply_subtree_height - demand_subtree_height
```

When `|econ_balance_i| > θ` trigger local rotation (rebalance). `θ` is system tolerance (like AVL ±1).

**Rebalancing action (examples):**

* If `econ_balance_i >> θ` (too much supply): reduce local price, encourage outbound lending/share, mint reserve token to black buffer.
* If `econ_balance_i << -θ` (too much demand): increase allocation from neighbor KNN nodes, temporarily convert red exposure into short term loan with higher fee, route request via A* to nearest supplies.

**Cost as vector operation** (example of a purchase):

You want to convert a scalar payment `p` across domains (house/travel/food). Represent a user's intended allocation weights `w` (sums to 1). Payment vector:

```
p_vector = p * w = [p*w_house, p*w_travel, p*w_food]
```

If route cost multipliers `c(x)` (from topology distance/time/fragility), effective cost:

```
effective_cost = p_vector ⊙ c(x)    // elementwise multiply
```

If shortage in a dimension, adaptive surcharge `σ_dim` applies; this comes from the RB reserve policy.

# C — Architecture + small prototype sketch

## Layers

1. **Edge (local HDIS agent)**

   * Runs KNN for local density, keeps supply/demand lists, computes `coherence_i`.
   * Issues witness receipts (signed short proofs).

2. **Cluster Index (AVL local balancer)**

   * Indexes resources with self-balancing trees for fast lookup and rotations → local rebalancing actions.

3. **Ledger (RB tree / DAG hybrid)**

   * Stores tokenized equity shares, witness receipts, reserves.
   * RB tree properties keep indexing stable for many inserts/deletes. Coloring encodes stable (black) vs volatile (red) holdings.

4. **Routing (A* + graph pruning)**

   * Finds lowest-cost path to satisfy requests using distance + reliability heuristics.

5. **Governance layer**

   * Slow clock: constitutional rules, dispute resolution, legal anchors (centralized anchors for trust + decentralized fallback).

## Data flows (brief)

* User asks to *book housing*. Edge agent checks local AVL index. If local `balance >= threshold`, allocate. Otherwise query KNN neighbors (A* routing). If allocation requires resources from reserve, ledger executes a provisional red exposure; later recolor to black when settled.

## Pseudocode (very small): local rebalancer

```python
# Node local state
S = get_local_supply()
D = get_local_demand()
econ_balance = height(S) - height(D)    # proxy using AVL heights
THRESH = 1

if abs(econ_balance) > THRESH:
    # rotate / rebalance
    if econ_balance > THRESH:
        # surplus: advertise lending, mint reserve
        reduce_price_by(factor=0.95)
        mint_reserve_fraction(amount = surplus_value * 0.1)
    else:
        # shortage: call neighbors via KNN
        neighbor = knn_find_best_supplier(k=5)
        path = a_star_find_path(self, neighbor, cost_fn)
        route_request(path)
        # if routing fails, create red_exposure loan
        ledger.create_red_exposure(self, amount = needed_value, terms=short_term)
```

## How RB color logic could work for assets

* On loan issuance: mark the loan entry **red** (exposure).
* When collateral or repayments hit reserve threshold, recolor **black**.
* On deletion (default), run RB delete fixups → trigger reserve transfers and witness logging.

# Example numeric flow (the £20/£10/£5 example)

User wants to move:

* Housing deposit: £20
* Travel: £10
* Food: £5

Weights `w = [0.57, 0.29, 0.14]` (normalized from amounts).

1. Edge computes local supply; finds travel supply limited => `c_travel = 1.4` (surcharge). House supply OK `c_house=1.0`, food `c_food=1.1`.
2. `effective_vector = [20*1, 10*1.4, 5*1.1] = [20, 14, 5.5]` = total £39.5.
3. Coherence low (cluster shortage). Since `econ_balance < -θ`, route travel to neighbor cluster (A* finds path with reliability 0.9); travel cost adjusted to £13 (discount) if neighbor agrees to lend supply in exchange for future witness receipts.
4. If neighbor can't route, system issues short red exposure loan of £4 to cover immediate gap; ledger marks it red. When user settles or neighbor supplies, ledger recolors to black and reserve increased.

# Governance & ownership notes (fast)

* **Ownership evolves slowest**: fractionalized asset tokens (time-share → tradable shares) that vest based on witness receipts and participation metrics.
* **Governance evolves moderately**: local councils get adaptive quorum thresholds based on cluster coherence (high coherence → lower quorum required; low coherence → manual oversight).
* **Value evolves fastest**: price vectors respond continuously to topology, latency, witness reliability.

---

# Practical next steps (two sprint roadmap)

1. **Simulate**: build a discrete-event sim with nodes, KNN density, AVL local balancing and RB ledger index. Feed join/leave churn and shock scenarios (bus delay, food shortage). Measure coherence, #red exposures, recolor rates.
2. **Prototype edge agent**: implement local KNN + simple AVL index + witness receipts signing (Ed25519). Use a lightweight off-chain DAG for fast proof exchange.
3. **Define constitutional rules**: 10 rules that must be machine-verifiable (no forced pre-checked consent, minimum reserve ratio, max exposure per node).
4. **Run small field pilot**: one cluster of 50 users, one anchored ledger server, 5 neighbor nodes, test booking + failover.

---

# One-liner 

Let price be a *field*, nodes be *particles*, and rebalancing be the physics — AVL keeps the field smooth locally, RB keeps the index stable globally, KNN decides who you borrow from, and witness receipts are your proof-of-reliability when the field gets rough.
